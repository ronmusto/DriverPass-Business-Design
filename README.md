# DriverPass-Business-Design
The client for this project is DriverPass they wanted me to design a system that allowed them to provide online driving classes to students and to allow them to schedule in person driving appointments. The client also wanted the system to have the ability to be updated by the Admin as needed and to have a secretary account be able to set up accounts and classes for potential customers. I think that something I did particularly well was to identify the functional and nonfunctional requirements of this system. I beleive based on the interview that was conducted I ecompassed all of the required functionality for the client. I think that if I could go back and make something a little stronger it would be the class diagram. We were not required to add methods to it but I think that the diagram would be a lot more useful if they were added. As I was designing the system I envisioned how it would be to use what I was working on and what I would need to use it properly. This helped me make sure that I kept the users needs in mind. Personally I like to approach desiging software by first doing as much fact gathering as possible so that I know exactly what is expected of me then from there I break down the project into smaller and smaller componenets so I can focus on one idea at a time and give it my full attention.
